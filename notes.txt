- need to handle single tuple or lsit of items
- make actual ast node be "node" off of subclass?
- itemiterator index is totally fucked
- need shortcuts for descend, pass, ignore, etc. Too much boilerplate.
- need helpers for multiple descend like self.descend(Vol).descend(Reporter).descend(Number)
- visitors should be as functional as possible; return the tree after visiting
- for the love of god. need a namedtuple for working with items
- need methods for querying the tree
